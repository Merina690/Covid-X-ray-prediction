# Covid X-ray Classification
As we know that covid-19 has increased the mortality rate in a short period of time. 
So in order to classify the people chest x-ray, I have used the CNN to segregate the chest x-ray's in an effective way with the help of Convolutional layers 

This project helps the hospital faculty in predicting the covid affected patients and treat them effectively in initial stages.

## Lesson Learned


Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep learning algorithm that is particularly well-suited for image recognition and processing tasks. It is made up of multiple layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

CNN works with the images, which helps in identifying the different images uniquely.
